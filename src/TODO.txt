-Keep instances in array (NOT TreeMap)
-Pass to CMD class current QuackBot instance

Dynamic Recompile and Reload
-Inform all bots about Recomp - Bots inform channels and lock bot
-Get all CMD method contents
-BACKUP cmd classes
-Recompile CORRECTLY
-Compare new contents agianst old contents
-Inform all bots new methods - Bots inform channel

Subclass (or interface) CMD class
-Needed for dynamic CMD package
-Super contains basic class variables to be set by Quackbot
-All CMD classes extend or impliment it
-In invoke code, get class instance from method and class list, cast to whatever, set vars, and run on object

Dynamic CMD package
