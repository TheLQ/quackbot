	      There are three means to configure Wickets configuration mode and they are
	      tested in the order given. 
	      1) A system property: -Dwicket.configuration
	      2) servlet specific <init-param>
	      3) context specific <context-param>
	      The value might be either "development" (reloading when templates change)
	      or "deployment". If no configuration is found, "development" is the default.
